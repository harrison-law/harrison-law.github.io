When one begins their journey in programming, their code often looks like the wild, wild West, with questionable indentations all over, inconsistent bracketing, and a lack of elegance from the human perspective. Thankfully for myself, I was always pretty neat and consistent about my code, always writing something that probably made my teachers' lives easier. But why does it matter how our code looks? As long as the computer can interpret the ones and zeroes that our code ultimately boils down to, does it matter whether our code is nice and readable to the human eye? The answer to this question is obviously yes, but to what extent is it true? Who cares if we have single or double quotes or if we put an extra line between if statements or not?

Unfortunately for some but fortunately for the poor souls who have to read and interpret our code, oftentimes these minute details do matter quite a lot. Although I don't believe that following a set of coding standards is necessarily the most important part of software engineering, I do believe that writing easily understandable code that follows a set pattern makes life a lot easier, especially when it comes to writing code that is used by not only yourself but by others who have to understand why things are the way they are. Implementing basic coding standards in a program not only makes it easier to interpret from another person's point of view, but it also makes it easier to identify errors in a program, as errors are more easily caught if you understand which parts of the code perform what action. Overall, the principle of coding standards is quite important to take to heart when it comes to software engineering, as it plays a big role in making software engineering an engineering discipline in the first place.

This principle has reared its head in my life with the application of ESLint in my TypeScript code, as I have begun to implement its coding standards into my programs. Many of the rules of ESLint are those I abide by in my  personal coding standards, but it has been a slight adjustment for me. Thankfully VSCode makes life a lot easier when it comes to correcting simple syntax things that ESLint doesn't approve of, so correcting these errors hasn't added too much hassle to my coding. Though I agree with coding standards as a whole, I have come to disagree with some aspects of ESLint, as I find many things about it too picky and almost irrelevant to any ideas that form the basis of coding standards, like throwing errors for using double quotes instead of single quotes or having an extra space at the end of a line. All in all, although I'm not the biggest fan of ESLint and its annoying elements, I believe wholeheartedly that coding standards are an important skill in any programmer's toolkit and will continue to hone them as long as I decide to write code.
