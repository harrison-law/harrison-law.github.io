I made my effort estimates by just making an education guess based on my previous experience and what my group members put. I didn't really think there were any benefits that came from making these estimations as I really didn't care about what my estimate was because it didn't really matter. In the real world I can see how this would be important but in this case I didn't see the benefit. I think there was benefit from actually tracking how long things took because doing so allowed me to know how much time I really spent doing certain tasks and seeing where I could improve off of this information. I tracked my effort using a VSCode plug in called Wakatime for my coding effort and used a timer to track my out of code efforts. My tracking of the coding time would be accurate because of this but my non-coding tracking could be a little off due to not always timing things I did and also not continuously working all of the time I tracked. There wasn't much overhead in tracking my effort, as it was just something that happened while doing my work anyways. The only time extra it took me was installing Wakatime but that took a few minutes at most and didn't affect my progress working on the project.
