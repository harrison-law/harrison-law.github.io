## Experiences with Typescript
Next stop: Typescript. Along the journey of programming, most programmers try their hand at many coding languages, as they all come with their own strengths and weaknesses that make people gravitate towards one or another. For me, this journey has brought me to learning Typescript, a simple scripting language based on Javascript but with type declarations (and a few other features), through ICS 314, Introduction to Software Engineering here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Despite being unrelated, learning Typescript reminds me of first learning Java, as the basics of Javascript and subsequently Typescript have felt familiar to what I learned in Java in the syntax department, probably due to the similiarities in how objects are created and function. 

However, it has taken some time to adjust to the many nuiances of Typescript, as I've spent a lot of my recent time coding in Python, so getting back into the habit of declaring types or variables and return values took a while. I also did keep forgetting to type semicolons for a while, which is a bit funny to think about. Overall, there have been some slight adjustments I've had to make while programming in Typescript but since I have only really used Typescript on a very surface level to complete simple tasks, it hasn't been too drastic of a change compared to programming in other languages.

### Experiences with athletic software engineering
The structure of how I have been learning Typescript, however, has been quite a contrast to the way I've learned other languages. In ICS 314, we have used a philosophy called "athletic software engineering", in which we perform "workout of the days" (WODs) in class to hone our skills that we learned before coming to class. Although I have used this reverse class structure before, where assignments are done in class and learning is done outside of it, this has felt different because of how much emphasis is put into practicing for the WODs. With a few practice WODs being done outside of class, the practical practice focus on the outside of class learning has been nice, as being able to learn while doing basically exactly what we will be "quizzed" on the following week has been quite helpful. Although I do find learning outside of class difficult at times (I'm not the most focused person), it has overall been a pretty decent and enjoyable experience. 

Despite my overall positive view on how I've had to learn Typescript, I still find that there are troubles in this method of learning. A lot of emphasis has been put on the use of AI, which although is a good discussion idea, has cut into time I feel could be spent more on reviewing to obtain a deeper understanding of the topics covered. I'm also not the biggest fan of having to sit through recorded lectures, as I find them too impersonally and hard to remember. All in all, I have found learning Typescript to be a decently enjoyable experience, and I hope to be able to use it on a bigger project in order to truly see if Typescript can be the programming language for me.
