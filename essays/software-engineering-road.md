Growing up, I thought I would be doing many things with my life. From dreaming of being a paleontologist when I was younger to thinking I would make robots throughout high school, being sure of what I'd do with my future was never really a characteristic of mine. Up until my senior year of high school, I figured I'd go to college to study mechanical engineering, as I was strong in many STEM disciplines and enjoyed learning about and working with robots. However, this randomly changed (and I really do mean randomly) when I started applying for university, as all of a sudden I found myself leaning towards studying computer science, with the idea in the future that I would become a software engineer. 

I had an idea of what software engineering was (or at least I thought I did), as I took various programming and computer science classes growing up. I always considered coding a relatively important skill no matter what field I would choose to pursue, as I always knew it would allow for me to create more than I could without it. As I accepted by fate of being a software engineer in the future, I had to consider what I was truly looking forward to in the field. I eventually came to be excited for a few things, namely the vast ocean of possibile creations that programming leads to. Although it's unlikely that I will be working on my own project as a software engineer, the knowledge attained through my potential work as a software engineer will allow me to further any person endeavors I may have.

Speaking of which, beyond the skills I hope to gain as a programmer, I hope that pursuing a job as a software engineer will teach me more about developing a project and managing its growth. Many people say they wish to have their work outlive them, and I hope that in my quest to be a competent software engineer that I learn the skills to possibly make this statement true. I also hope to experience the future of technology through being a software engineer, as there are countless possibilites to contribute to a revolutionary product or idea that changes the way we live in the future (for the better in theory). Software engineering is a field with a wide variety of possibilities, and I hope to experience these possibilites in my pursuit of being one.
