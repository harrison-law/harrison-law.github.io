Growing up, I thought I would be doing many things with my life. From dreaming of being a paleontologist when I was younger to thinking I would make robots throughout high school, being sure of what I'd do with my future was never really a characteristic of mine. Up until my senior year of high school, I figured I'd go to college to study mechanical engineering, as I was strong in many STEM disciplines and enjoyed learning about and working with robots. However, this randomly changed (and I really do mean randomly) when I started applying for university, as all of a sudden I found myself leaning towards studying computer science, with the idea in the future that I would become a software engineer. 

I had an idea of what software engineering was (or at least I thought I did), as I took various programming and computer science classes growing up. I always considered coding a relatively important skill no matter what field I would choose to pursue, as I always knew it would allow for me to create more than I could without it. As I accepted by fate of being a software engineer in the future, I had to consider what I was truly looking forward to in the field. I eventually came to be excited for a few things, namely the vast ocean of possibile creations that programming leads to. Although it's unlikely that I will be working on my own project as a software engineer, the opportunities that the knowledge attained
