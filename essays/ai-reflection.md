I. AI has been the big new revolution in the world, playing a significant role in the way we live our day to day lives. This can be prevalently seen in education, where figuring out how to use AI to benefit learning has been a hot topic in the world. In particular, learning to code and thus learning to become a software engineer has been hit just as hard as any other field, as AI has made creating projects easier than ever before. I have experience the power of AI through my time in ICS 314, as I have used AI to write a lot of the code I used in the class but also helped me learn what exactly I was writing and why. I have used a multitude of AI tools while programming for this class, including Github Copilot, ChatGPT, ClaudeAI, and Deepseek to name a few, and have had the best results using ClaudeAI so far.

II. For the in-class WODs in this class, I tried not to use AI as much as possible, as I felt that it would be the best way to learn, but in the later weeks I was struggling to do some design aspects in the alloted time frame, leading to an increased use of AI when I was running out of time. The experience WODs I mostly did on my own, as there was no time pressure per say, but at times I would forget to do them so I would just AI the solution. For the essays, I just wrote them on my own because I felt that it would best convey the ideas I wanted, along with the fact that personal opinion made up a good portion of the essays. On the final project I used AI to write just about all of my code, as most of the issues I did were either tedious in nature or were something I didn't fully have a grasp on, making it easier to just AI the code and understand it later. I used AI to learn concepts just by learning based on the explanation of code it gave me, as I didn't use it necessarily as a tool to learn as well as I should have. I also had it answer questions in class because we were told to look it up with AI. When it comes to answering smart questions and creating coding examples, I never really used AI as I didn't find these things necessary in this class. I did however use AI very often to explain, write, and document code as it streamlined the process and made it so I just overall did less work.

III. The incorporation of AI into my learning experience has had a significant impact on how I approach comprehension, skill development, and problem-solving in software engineering. AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and AI-driven code analyzers have become valuable resources for exploring new concepts, debugging code, and accelerating the learning process. From a comprehension standpoint, AI has enhanced my ability to understand difficult topics by providing real-time explanations, examples, and analogies. When a lecture or textbook concept wasn’t immediately clear, I could use AI to get alternative explanations or walk through examples step-by-step. This made it easier to grasp abstract software engineering principles like design patterns, test-driven development, and version control workflows. In terms of skill development, AI has been most helpful in reinforcing practical programming habits. For instance, while working on assignments involving issue tracking, Agile development, and collaborative coding, I used AI to review best practices for writing clean code, handling edge cases, and documenting work clearly. It encouraged me to think critically about design choices and project structure, which helped build my confidence in real-world software practices. As for problem-solving abilities, AI provided an additional layer of support. When stuck on a bug or unsure how to implement a certain feature, AI helped me brainstorm possible solutions or identify overlooked logic errors. This assistance often helped me overcome roadblocks faster than relying solely on documentation or forums. However, I also had to learn to use AI responsibly—cross-checking its output and making sure I understood the rationale behind suggestions instead of copying blindly. This self-awareness ultimately strengthened my debugging and critical thinking skills. That said, there were moments when AI felt like a shortcut, and I had to be careful not to let it replace my own reasoning. The most valuable learning happened when I used AI as a guide rather than a solution provider.

IV. Beyond ICS 314, AI has proven to be a powerful tool in real-world software engineering contexts. For example, in my personal projects I leveraged AI-driven tools for project planning, code optimization, and even UI prototyping. Language models like ChatGPT were used to generate boilerplate code, validate API designs, and troubleshoot logic errors—saving time and improving efficiency. In collaborative settings, AI facilitated smoother communication of technical ideas through code comments and documentation generation. While AI tools are not a replacement for deep understanding, they have significantly accelerated the development cycle and allowed more focus on innovation and design. Overall, AI has been effective in addressing real-world challenges such as code quality, debugging, and user experience.

V. A notable challenge with AI integration in the course was the temptation to over-rely on tools for code generation or explanations without fully understanding the underlying concepts. This sometimes led to shallow comprehension or debugging difficulties when AI-generated solutions didn’t align with assignment constraints. Another issue was AI occasionally providing outdated or incorrect information, which required manual verification. On the opportunity side, AI could be further integrated into ICS 314 through interactive code reviews, smart feedback systems, or AI tutors that adaptively assess a student’s knowledge gaps and provide customized practice. There’s also potential for AI to aid in peer evaluations and team dynamics analysis in group projects, helping instructors better track student engagement and contributions.

VI. Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI-enhanced approaches provide several advantages. Traditional methods emphasize fundamentals, guided lectures, and structured assignments, which build strong theoretical foundations. However, they often lack immediate feedback or adaptability. AI tools complement this by offering on-demand explanations, code suggestions, and simulated real-world scenarios that promote active learning. Engagement tends to increase with AI because of the interactive nature of the tools. Students can experiment, receive instant feedback, and iterate quickly. In terms of knowledge retention, AI may improve outcomes if used judiciously, as students get more practice applying concepts rather than passively consuming content. For practical skill development, AI serves as a coach rather than a crutch—enhancing skills like debugging, test writing, and code refactoring through real-time suggestions and analysis.

VII. Looking ahead, the role of AI in software engineering education is likely to expand significantly. AI could power adaptive learning environments that tailor content based on individual performance, provide intelligent code assistance, and simulate collaborative software development in agile settings. However, maintaining academic integrity and ensuring deep conceptual understanding will remain key challenges. Future courses could integrate AI tools with learning management systems (e.g., GitHub Copilot integrated with VSCode and Laulima) to streamline development and assessment. It’s also important to teach students how to critically evaluate and debug AI-generated code, fostering responsible and informed use of these technologies.

VIII. AI has had a transformative impact on learning software engineering, particularly in enhancing comprehension, accelerating development, and supporting collaborative work. In ICS 314 and beyond, it has offered valuable support but also presented challenges that require mindful usage. The future of software engineering education should embrace AI not as a shortcut, but as a tool for deeper exploration and skill development. To optimize its integration, educators should combine traditional instruction with AI-enhanced tools, promote ethical use, and encourage critical thinking. With the right balance, AI can significantly enrich the educational experience.
