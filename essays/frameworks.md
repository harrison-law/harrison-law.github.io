Since before the beginning of this millenium, the internet as we know it has dictated our lives, deciding what we see when we go online. As with most other things, people sought to innovate upon the creation of the websites we see there, helping make web design easier and more accessible to those who don't want to learn how to do it from scratch. This innovation has led to the various UI frameworks seen in almost every website accessible on the internet, which begs the question: is it worth it to learn a framework or just create websites from scratch? In this essay, I will outline what I percieve to be the various benefits and downfalls of using UI frameworks in website creation.

During this last week, I have spent countless hours recreating websites using Bootstrap 5, a popular UI framework, for various homework assignments, which has given me an idea as to where its implementation makes life easier than using raw HTML and CSS. For starters, the obvious benefit of using a framework is having a foundation layed out for you to easily build upon, as most of the common website features are already built into the framework and can be written in significantly less lines than without it. Being able to create an entire functioning website that I would find acceptable in less than an hour without the use of external code has been a shocker for me, as I was never able to have such efficient production while just using HTML and CSS. This efficiency also comes with a lot less designing, as most of the auto formatting built into Bootstrap has been quite visually appealing (or at least visually acceptable). Using Bootstrap has also opened my eyes to a lot of features that I didn't necessarily consider for a website, as while building websites on my own using just HTML and CSS I never really considered adding certain features that come default when using Bootstrap. In a professional sense, I would imaging using a framework does have some benefit, as it allows for easier modification and updating, which is crucial to consider in a software engineering sense.

However, using Bootstrap has came with its own issues, mainly being that it's much harder to get things exactly how you want them. I have often had trouble lining things up exactly how I want them to be without directly doing the alignment myself, which defeats some of the purpose of using a framework in the first place. This may have simply been a skill issue, as I haven't had the most experience using Bootstrap, but I'd still consider this a disadvantage considering the steep learning curve of using a framework effectively. To achieve the customizability desired for many would take a lot of time to learn, which isn't ideal when using a framework to optimize performance in the first place. Overall, much of the tradeoffs when using a framework come down to efficiency versus ease of customization, as using a framework is decently limiting when it comes to getting something to look exactly how you want it to. This tradeoff is still one I would give to the framework, as having a nice, less empty base to work off makes creating a website a more smooth process in my opinion, but it is still something to consider when deciding whether to use a framework or start from scratch using just HTML or CSS.
