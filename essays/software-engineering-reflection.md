In ICS 314, we have covered many useful software engineering principles that carry over beyond the simple web applications we have used them for, including utilizing different development environments, open source software, and ethics in software engineering. Learning about these topics not only helped me work on my projects in this class but changed the way I think about software development as a whole, shaping the way I not only write code but think about how programs work as a whole. One of these concepts that has impacted the way I think about these topics is the concept of open source software development, which is the concept of utilizing open source (or public) code on your own projects. This concept is particularly useful when starting a project, as open source resources and code often provide a good jumping off point that you can refactor to suit your project's own needs. I had a lot of practice using open source resources in this class, as often I would get stuck on questions and have to utilize resources such as StackOverflow and trusty Google to find answers to problems I had. I've also utilized open source resources on my own personal projects, as they have often provided good templates to build upon when making something that builds upon a publicly common idea.

Another fundamental concept covered in ICS 314 that has impacted the way I view software engineering is agile project management, which is a system to development projects that contains meeting differnt milestones and goals that break a larger project or task up into smaller ones. This isn't a revolutionary idea in the real world, as most things in life are broken into smaller problems to be solved, but this idea hasn't always been something I considered when I thought about developing software. Often times I have found it overwhelming when working on a project, as it is easy to see the long journey ahead and think about all of the things you need to do, stressing you out and making it hard to get real work done. Using this concept in this class helped make our final project quite manageable, as instead of seeing it as developing a whole website in the short alloted time, it felt more like completing several smaller homework assignments, making it easy to grasp and contributed to my success in the project. Overall, this concept and the many others we covered have contributed to my understanding of software engineering as a discipline and have impacted the way I develop programs as a whole.
