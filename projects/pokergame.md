summary: "I developed a text-based, playable Texas Hold'em poker program with functioning game logic."

Texas Hold'em poker is the most popular form of poker around the world, in which each player is dealt two cards, and along with a community five cards, makes the best possible hand using any 5 card combination. I often enjoy playing this variation of poker with my family, so I thought that recreating it would be a fun endeavor to embark on. 

Using python, I created various classes to represent the different aspects of the game and implemented the game logic to deduce who won a given hand. This, in combination with a text-based interface representing the given options per round and cards, allows users to actually play Texas Hold'em poker in this program.
