In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a working database using C. This database allowed users to add records to the database, print the records found in the database, find a specific record in the database, and delete records from the database. Each record contained an account number, name, and address, with the records being stored in the database using a linked list structure. After the user finished interacting with the program and chose to quit, the current database would then be transferred and saved in a file that could be accessed the next time the user wanted to access the database. The program itself operatated on two separate fronts, with the user interface and database being accessed seperately, keeping the theoretic users' information stored away from anything accessible by the user. This program operated in the terminal of the computer using a UNIX framework, with vi being used as the code editor of choice.

Working on this project helped strengthen my skills in C, as there were many instances of pointers at use in this program that had to be referenced and dereferenced correctly in order for the program to function correctly. This assignment also improved my ability to work directly in the terminal and use its many shortcuts in order to optimize workflow. Beyond the basic coding abilities this project helped strengthen, working on a project of this size also helped improve my ability to plan out projects and design a program that is not only function but also easily interpretable and improvable. This was the first project I worked on involving multiple files interacting with each other, so being able to strengthen these skills has helped me with larger projects I work on to this day.
